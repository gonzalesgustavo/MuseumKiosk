# MuseumKiosk

This project was created with Angular version 7.3.0. This is a demo project for a museum kiosk displaying data about fossils. This uses the fossil API. For testing purposes I suggest using the static server which does not require a mongolab url. The static server is included.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Interface

Below is the single page app the visitor would see. The project requirements were, a basic UI with minimal use of color and design.

When the visitor/user hovers over the image with the cursor the car would flip and display information on the fossil. Below is an image displaying what it looks like.
